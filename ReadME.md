# Bit torrent

    BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that enables users to distribute large amounts of data over the internet efficiently. Instead of relying on a central server, BitTorrent breaks files into small chunks and allows users to download and upload these chunks simultaneously from multiple sources. This decentralized approach results in faster downloads and reduces the strain on any single server, making it ideal for distributing large files like movies, software, and games.

# Why Bit torrent

BitTorrent possess several features of distributed systems:

1. Decentralization: BitTorrent operates without a central server. Instead, it relies on a network of interconnected peers, allowing each user to act both as a downloader and an uploader.

2. Scalability: As more users join a BitTorrent swarm, the overall bandwidth and resources available for sharing files increase, leading to improved download speeds and resilience against network congestion.

3. Fault tolerance: Since BitTorrent does not rely on a single point of failure, it is inherently resilient to individual node failures or network disruptions. Even if some peers become unavailable, others can continue to share the file.

4. Load balancing: BitTorrent dynamically allocates bandwidth among peers based on their upload and download speeds, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimal distribution of the file chunks.

5. Self-organization: Peers in a BitTorrent network autonomously discover each other and collaborate to distribute files. This self-organizing behavior allows the network to adapt to changing conditions and efficiently manage file transfers without centralized coordination.

# What Makes Our BitTorrent Stand Out?

## Caching
    Our BitTorrent implementation incorporates caching mechanisms to enhance data retrieval efficiency. By caching frequently accessed chunks locally, peers can reduce the need for redundant downloads and expedite file transfers.

## RPC Integration: 
    Utilizing Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), our BitTorrent network facilitates seamless communication and coordination among peers. This integration streamlines the sharing process by enabling efficient exchange of information and resource management within the decentralized network.
